An attempt at learning the use of comonads in computer science through hands on experience.

Inspired by [What is a Comonad? â€“ Comath and Mputer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8pjE2JMv-c).

I am but an undergrad trying to learn computer science, and any corrections would be appreciated; please let me know if I got anything wrong!
